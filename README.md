Example Voting App
=========

A simple distributed application running across multiple Docker containers.

Run the following command inside the directory directory:
```
docker compose up -d
```
The app will be running at [host-ip:5000], and the results will be at [host-ip:5001].

* A front-end web app in [Python](/vote) which lets you vote between two options
* A [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) queue which collects new votes
* A [Java](/worker/src/main) worker which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
* A [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) database backed by a Docker volume
* A [Node.js](/result) webapp which shows the results of the voting in real time


Notes
-----

The voting application only accepts one vote per client. It does not register votes if a vote has already been submitted from a client.

This isn't an example of a properly architected perfectly designed distributed app... it's just a simple 
example of the various types of pieces and languages you might see (queues, persistent data, etc), and how to 
deal with them in Docker at a basic level.
